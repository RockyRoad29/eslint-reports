* Overview

  When you first introduce linting tools liked [[https://eslint.org/][eslint]] in an existing project, you
may have to deal with the big amount of issues. This use case is described
and addressed in [[GH:IanVS/eslint-nibble]] , but, being fond of git,
I'd like to trace the work done, and make sure nothing gets broken in the
process. This precaution will likely be much appreciated when you'll submit
your pull request upstream.
